    """
    Return a tidy df of cluster information for a kmeans clustering algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : sklearn.cluster.KMeans
        The model to extract the cluster specific information from. 
    dataframe : pandas dataframe
        The data to which the Kmeans object has been fitted

    Returns
    -------
    df : pandas dataframe
        A dataframe with k rows, where k is the number of clusters and 3 columns,
        describing respectively the center of the cluster, the sum of inertia of the
        cluster, and the number of associated data points in a cluster.

    Examples
    --------
    These are written in doctest format, and should illustrate how to
    use the function.

    a = [1, 2, 3]
    print([x + 3 for x in a])
    [4, 5, 6]
    print("a\nb")
